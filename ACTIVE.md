# My Subjective Ratings of PC Games

- Ordered by released date.
- Extremly subjective!
- Only list games I owned and played.

## Q & A

#### What's the purpose of this?
I need to find a certain way to record and order all games I owned and played by release date. Originally it was planned to be updated in my Steam profile but it exceeds the max length of it. In a way, it's only a personal list.

#### How much is the full mark of the following scores?
10

#### I'm so angry that you gave my favorite game an unbelievably low mark!
Sorry...
